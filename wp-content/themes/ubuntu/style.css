Description: Donate: https://opencollective.com/UbuntuZero13. Learn: https://ubuntuZero13.me/. UbuntuZero13 is the definitive WordPress boilerplate starter theme. I've carefully constructed the most clean and minimalist theme possible for designers and developers to use as a base to build websites for clients or to build completely custom themes from scratch. Clean, simple, unstyled, semi-minified, unformatted, and valid code, SEO-friendly, jQuery-enabled, no programmer comments, standardized and as white label as possible, and most importantly, the CSS is reset for cross-browser-compatability, with no intrusive visual CSS styles added whatsoever. A perfect skeleton theme. For support and suggestions, go to: https://github.com/bhadaway/ubuntuZero13/issues. Thank you.
